Article tag:
The article tag is used for wrapping an autonomous content on a page.
A content is autonomous if it can be removed from the page and put on some another page.

Section tag:
The section tag is similar to the div tag, but it is more meaningful since it wraps 
logical groups of related content (e.g. a chapter of an article).
